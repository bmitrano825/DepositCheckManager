This is a small Windows program meant for use with Neat desktop scanners. 

The program was made to easily allow the scanning of multiple images of deposit checks from rental units. The program will automatically save the images to the specified path organized by Building Name > Year > Month > Day. 
 
The program uses the NAPS2.SDK library to interact with the scanner as well as SQLite to store the file path and building names.
